This is an app designed using the Ethereum block chain with a React front-end. The application is designed as a blockchain payment and approval system, for use in such applications as Kickstarter. The application allows a 'manager' to open a new funding campaign, allows 'donaters' to fund the campaign, and requires the approval of 'donators' before the manager can send out money to vendors from the blockchain contract. 

This application was designed in conjuction with a Udemy course taught be Stephen Grinder.
